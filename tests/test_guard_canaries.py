"""Canary tests: if an environment claims a marker, the symbols behind it must import.

``tests/test_guard_declarations.py`` asserts that each declared symbol either resolves
or explains the extra it needs -- deliberately true whichever way an environment is
built. That is exactly why it cannot catch a *misconfigured* one, where a tox
environment or CI job selects ``-m opencv`` without the OpenCV extra actually installed.

These tests close that gap. Each is generated from a ``Group`` that declares extras and
carries the marker for those extras, so selecting a marker asserts the matching symbols
are importable, and failing is a hard ``pytest.fail`` rather than a skip.

Nothing here is edited when adding an implementation: declaring the ``Group`` is what
creates its canary.
