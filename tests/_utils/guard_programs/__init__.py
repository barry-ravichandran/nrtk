"""Programs run in a fresh interpreter by ``tests/test_import_guards_e2e.py``.

Each module here is a standalone script, not a test. They live as real files
rather than strings inside the test so that ruff and pyright see them, and so a
failure points at a line you can open. Every one prints a single line that the
calling test compares against.
