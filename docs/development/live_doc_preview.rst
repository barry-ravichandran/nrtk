Live Documentation Preview
==========================

While writing documentation in a markup format such as `reStructuredText`_, it
is very helpful to preview the formatted version of the text.
While it is possible to simply run the ``make html`` command periodically, a
more seamless workflow of this is available.
Within the :file:`docs/` directory is a small Python script called
:file:`sphinx_server.py` that can simply be called with:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ poetry run python sphinx_server.py

This will run a small process that watches the :file:`docs/` folder contents,
as well as the source files in :file:`src/nrtk/`, for changes.
:command:`make html` is re-run automatically when changes are detected.
This will serve the resulting HTML files at http://localhost:5500.
Having this URL open in a browser will provide you with an up-to-date
preview of the rendered documentation.
