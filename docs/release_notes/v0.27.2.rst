v0.27.2
=======

This patch release improves error messaging for optional-extra imports, adds
bounds validation and warnings for ``RandomCropPerturber`` and
``WaterDropletPerturber``, and includes corresponding test coverage.

Updates
-------

* Updated import guard error messages across all optional-extra modules to surface
  the original upstream ``ImportError`` when an extra is installed but fails to import
  due to a transitive dependency issue. Previously, users would only see a message to
  install the extra even when it was already installed.

* Updated ``crop_size`` check in ``RandomCropPerturber.perturb`` to check width and height by element and
  to warn the user if ``crop_size`` is greater than image size.

Additions
---------

* Added ``test_crop_size_bounds`` to ``TestRandomCropPerturber`` to check ``crop_size`` warning.

* Added a ``UserWarning`` in ``WaterDropletPerturber`` when ``size_range`` values are
  below the minimum effective droplet size of ``0.1``. The water droplet model enforces
  a minimum droplet radius of ``0.1`` in glass coordinate units; values below this
  threshold are clamped to ``0.1``. Updated docstrings to document this constraint and
  advise using ``num_drops`` to control the number of droplets instead.

* Added ``test_size_range_below_minimum_warns`` and ``test_size_range_above_minimum_no_warning``
  to ``TestWaterDropletPerturber`` to verify the new warning behavior.
