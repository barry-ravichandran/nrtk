Testing & Evaluation Guides with MAITE
=======================================

Many robustness testing workflows benefit from using NRTK alongside other tools such as the
`JATIC <https://cdao.pages.jatic.net/public/>`_ program's
`Modular AI Trustworthy Engineering (MAITE) <https://github.com/mit-ll-ai-technology/maite>`_ toolbox. While NRTK
focuses on realistic image perturbations, MAITE provides a standardized interface for evaluating model performance
across a set of test conditions. Using these tools together enables modular, reproducible assessments of AI robustness
under simulated operational risks.

The following notebooks showcase how NRTK perturbations can be applied to simulate key operational risks within a
testing and evaluation (T&E) workflow. Each notebook illustrates potential impact on model performance, utilizing MAITE
as an evaluation harness.
