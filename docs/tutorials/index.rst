      :class-card: sd-border-2
      :columns: 12

      It is highly recommended to start with this tutorial. This tutorial walks through NRTK's
      three core capabilities—image perturbation, perturbation factories for parameter sweeps,
      and model evaluation—in a single end-to-end notebook.
